Intro
---

Step 0 : Gather Tools, Materials and Digital Artifacts
---

* Laser cutter
* EL Panel (red, A6)
* Inverter for EL panel and batteries
* EL cables and splitters
* Velcro
* Jacket
* Digital design
* Glue (Gorilla)
* Fabric (heavy duty Nylon, black) ([Amazon link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C6DAXE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1))
* Scissors
* (optional) Soldering Iron and Solder 

Step 1 : Prep Digital Design
---

* Make sure no 'island' regions (like desgining a stencil)
* Covnert to black and white image
* Make sure image is large enough

Step 2 : Cut on Laser Cutter and Inspect
---

* Nylon melts so is often forgiving in terms of dense regions
* Set laser power lower if cuts are too aggressive

Step 3 : Glue Laser Cut Fabric to EL Panel
---

* Make sure to take laminate off of panel if it exists
* Super glue and elmers don't work very well. I've had success with gorilla glue
* Try to keep it neat but often glue won't be visible when EL panel is lit up so it's not so critical
* Dab glue in dots onto back of fabric, especially in regions that could easily flap
* Cut panel that has any excess over edges
* (optional) Clean up edges of cut panel with marker or paint to minimize exposure and light bleeding

Step 4 : Place Patch on Jacket
---

* Position on jacket to a place that looks good
* Put one part of the velcro on the back of the EL patch and the other on the jacket
* (optional) Staple or sew velcro onto jacket for more security
* Cut slot in jacket to feed EL panel tab through so it's hidden from view
* Cut lining and feed EL panel wire through

Step 5 : Wire EL Panel on Jacket
---

* Cut lining in pocket and place battery pack there
* Feed the battery pack wire through the hole in the pocket and connect to EL panel
* Test to make sure connection is good and EL panel lights up
* Feed wire behind lining so wires don't scratch clots or skin while wearing the jacket

Step 6 : Wear It!
---

* Be awesome
